# Medium Clone – Blogging Platform Prototype

A functional prototype of a Medium-style blogging platform built using **React**, **PostgreSQL**, **Prisma ORM**, and **Hono**. This project was created to explore edge functions, serverless architectures, and modern full-stack development workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- Create, read, and manage blog posts
- Clean, responsive UI inspired by Medium
- Edge functions with Hono for lightning-fast serverless APIs
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for robust, type-safe database handling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
- **Hono** – Lightweight web framework for serverless and edge runtimes
- **Prisma ORM** – Type-safe and performant database client
- **React.js** – Frontend library for building interactive UIs
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Serverless Architecture** – Deployed using edge functions

## 📚 Purpose

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with:

- Serverless backends and edge-deployed functions
- Full-stack development using Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Styling modern UIs with Tailwind CSS
- Building scalable, performant prototypes using Hono and React
